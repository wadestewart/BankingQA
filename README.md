## Project 2 - Wade's financial literacy Q & A forum for online banking dashboard
================================================================================

### This app was built following the Model View Controller architecture and using MongoDB for the database, Express as the Node.js framework, Mongoose as the middleware for communication between Express and MongoDB, and Handlebars to render the content.

### My approach was to build an application to help online banking users ask questions to their bankers about financial topics.

### The features of this application are *1* user authentication, *2* full CRUD functionality so the database will read and render a predetermined list of financial topics - then a user can post a new topic and question or edit and delete a question that they have asked.

### For installation, you will need Node.js and MongoDB. The required dependencies for this application are: bcrypt-nodejs, body-parser, connect-flash, cookie-parser, ejs, express, express-ejs-layouts, express-handlebars, express-session, hbs, materialize, method-override, mongoose, morgan, nodemon, passport, passport-local.

### My unsolved problems are *1* user authentication: I do not have a functional signup or login - I receive an internal server error when I attempt these functions and my app breaks. I would also like to add CRUD functionality to my subtopics, but ran out of time and patience!
